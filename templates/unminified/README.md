# JavaScript template files

Here are located the original, unminified JavaScript and HTML files used by the
plugin.

If you need to modify `/templates/templates.js`, please do the changes on the
corresponding file in this folder and minify it (You can use the [online Closure
Compiler UI](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) for JavaScript files,
`Advanced` optimisation mode is preferred).
Then copy and paste the minified content in `/templates/templates.js`.
